			I can't believe people used to do this and still do somehow. Just fuckin' writing html by hand. I had an entire html for dummies book.<br>
			What a waste of time. Although if I had worked through that book a long time ago I wouldn't be needing to do some of this now. When I'm fuckin' 31.

		But here I am working it on it anyway, hoping that it can eventually lead to something where I have control over my life. I've been dependent on others for a long time.
		People that say money can't buy happiness like to ignore that not having it DEFINITELY can mean unhappiness.
		but
		i 
		don't 
		give 
		a 
		fuck 
		so 
		hope 
		this 
		is 
		enough.
